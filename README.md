# Teen-Design-Lab

The Teen Design Lab is an interactive platform where teens can participate in research studies, learn more about CSE, and invent in meaningful design
challenges. Currently, the site is in development mode and the rest of the README.md is for **contributors**. 


### Getting Started
First download all the code from this repository. 


From a root perspective the site looks as follows: 
```
  | .
  | client/
  | server/
```
  
The client folder holds all the code responsible for the frontend while the server holds all the code for the backend.

Then from each of the folder run npm init to install all the dependencies for this project. 

After that you should be able to start both the client and server using npm start from both the folders independently. If you need help please reach out!

At the end of this process you should be able to see everything as seen in this demo: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1ayyDaYvi10zOGK53ePOVEcwJ3DS8jO2E

### Notes to contributors
Most of the flies and folders should be self-explanatory but if anything is not please tell me and I will add it to this section.
